    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Homemade Lasagna</em></strong> is a classic Italian dish made
      by layering pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and
      cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. It’s baked until bubbly and
      golden. For best results, let it rest before serving to help the layers
      set. You can also freeze it for later by wrapping it tightly after it
      cools. Reheat in the oven for a comforting and hearty meal.

    <h2>Homemade Lasagna - Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
      lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
        meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
        the ground meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and
        a can of crushed tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
        parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
        from the tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is
        seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
        recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
        variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese
        and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus,
        they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until
        browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's
        translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley,
        garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
        salted water until they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the cheese layer:</strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan
        cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according
        to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
        lasagna is assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the lasagna</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the
        preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
        baking until the top is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How Long To Cook Lasagna</h2>

      uncovered).

    <h2>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers
      to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days.
      Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow
      it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap.
      Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up
      to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or
      microwave.
